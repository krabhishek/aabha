## What This Guide Will Cover

This comprehensive guide will explain:

- **What contexts are** - Perspectives/domains through which you view your product
- **Why contexts matter** - Different stakeholders, different expectations
- **Common context types** - Sales, Onboarding, Operations, Support, Compliance, Risk, Security, Audit, etc.
- **How to identify all relevant contexts** - Ensure complete coverage
- **Context patterns** - Customer-facing, internal, external contexts
- **Real-world examples** - OgPgy Bank's 8+ contexts explained
- **Same persona, different contexts** - Maria Santos across multiple contexts
- **Context completeness checklist** - Don't miss any perspective

## Key Concepts (Preview)

**Context = Perspective or Domain**

A Context represents a lens through which you view your product. Examples:
- Sales Context - How we acquire customers
- Onboarding Context - How customers get started
- Compliance Context - Regulatory requirements
- Support Context - How customers get help

**Why Multiple Contexts?**

Same product, different viewpoints:
- Customer cares about ease and speed
- Compliance cares about regulatory adherence
- Risk cares about fraud prevention
- Security cares about data protection
